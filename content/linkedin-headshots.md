# FAQ section
faqTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions"
faq:
  - question: "What should I wear for my headshots?"
    answer: "Dress for the position you want, not necessarily the one you have. If you're aiming for a leadership role, choose clothing that conveys authority and professionalism. You'll receive my worksheet guide 'Align Your Outfits to Your Brand' to help you make strategic wardrobe choices that support your career goals."
  - question: "Will you help me choose which photos work best for different platforms?"
    answer: "Absolutely! I'll guide you on which images work best for LinkedIn versus Instagram, Facebook, or your company website. Each platform has different cropping requirements and audience expectations - what works for a professional LinkedIn profile might not be ideal for a more casual Facebook presence."
  - question: "How many headshots do I actually need?"
    answer: "I recommend at least 2-3 different looks, but you can purchase as many or as few as you want. Many clients love having options - a formal one for corporate communications, a friendlier version for networking, and maybe something with personality for organizations like Toastmasters."
  - question: "What's the difference between a LinkedIn photo and a corporate headshot?"
    answer: "LinkedIn photos tend to be more approachable and personable, while corporate headshots are typically more formal and authoritative. We'll capture both styles during your session."
  - question: "Can I use these photos for marketing materials and websites?"
    answer: "Yes, your images come with full usage rights for all business and marketing purposes - websites, social media, business cards, brochures, advertisements, and more. The only restriction is you cannot sell the actual image files to others."
