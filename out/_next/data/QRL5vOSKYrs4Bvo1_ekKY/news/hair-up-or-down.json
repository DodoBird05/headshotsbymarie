Wrong question. The real question is: what job does this photo need to do? Here's how to decide based on whether you're shooting for beauty, acting, or branding.","image":"/images/Blog/Actor Headshot with Hair Down.webp","imageAlt":"Professional actor headshot with natural wavy hair down demonstrating approachable character type for casting","content":"\nThe most common question I get asked before a headshot session: \"Should I wear my hair up or down?\"\n\nAnd my answer is always the same: \"What's the photo for?\"\n\nI know, I know - you wanted a simple answer. But here's the thing: asking \"up or down\" is like asking \"should I wear jeans or a suit?\" Well... where are you going? A wedding or a barbecue?\n\nThe right hair choice isn't about what looks \"better.\" It's about what job the photo needs to do.\n\n## For Beauty and Modeling: Show Everything\n\n<img src=\"/images/Blog/Beauty Shot with Ponytail.webp\" alt=\"Beauty headshot with hair pulled back showing full facial features jawline and bone structure for modeling portfolio\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; max-width: 300px; border-radius: 4px;\" />\n\nIf you're shooting for beauty or modeling work, the answer is usually up - or at least pulled back enough that nothing is hidden.\n\nWhy? Because casting directors and agencies need to see your full features. Your jawline. Your neck. Your bone structure. Your ears. Everything.\n\nHair that covers any part of your face isn't mysterious or artistic in this context - it's just information they can't access. And when they're making decisions about who fits what job, they need all the information.\n\nThink of it like showing a house. You wouldn't leave half the rooms closed off and expect people to make an offer. Same principle.\n\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n## For Acting: Match the Character\n\nThis is where it gets fun - and way more specific.\n\nIf you're going out for FBI agent roles - think Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs or Olivia Dunham in Fringe - you want straight, polished hair. Professional. Put-together. Someone who has their act together even when hunting serial killers.\n\nAction movie hero? Sarah Connor in Terminator or Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games - ponytail. Practical. Ready to run. Not worried about looking pretty, worried about surviving.\n\nQuirky best friend? Bonnie Bennett in The Vampire Diaries or Gretchen Wieners in Mean Girls - cute, hair down. Approachable. Fun. The person you want to grab coffee with.\n\nThe casting director isn't just looking at your face - they're looking at whether you FIT the character. If you show up with a full blowout and balayage trying to play Cosette from Les Misérables, you've already told them you don't understand the role.\n\nYour headshot should show you AS the type of character you're going for. Not you on your best hair day.\n\n## For Branding: The Polished Version of Your Everyday Self\n\n<img src=\"/images/Blog/LinkedIn Profile Picture with Soft Curls.webp\" alt=\"Professional LinkedIn headshot with soft natural curls for personal branding photography\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; max-width: 300px; border-radius: 4px;\" />\n\nThis is where people get confused, because branding headshots feel like they should be \"professional\" which somehow translates to \"not really me.\"\n\nBut here's my rule: if you wear a messy bun to important business meetings, then come to your headshot with a messy bun.\n\nThe goal isn't to look like someone else's version of professional. The goal is to look like the professional version of YOU.\n\nBecause here's what happens if you don't: you show up to that client meeting or conference with your normal hair, and they look at you like \"wait, who are you?\" There's a disconnect between the photo and the real person. That's not good for anyone.\n\nThat said - and this is important - I want you to spend a little more time than usual making sure your hair looks exactly how you want it. Not different. Just the best version of your normal.\n\nIf you usually wear it down and wavy, make sure those waves are doing what you want them to do. If you rock a sleek ponytail, make sure it's sleek. This is your everyday style turned up to about an 8 out of 10, not a complete transformation to a 10.\n\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n## Pro Tip: Don't Wash Your Hair Right Before\n\nSeriously. Don't do it.\n\nFreshly washed hair has a mind of its own. Flyaways everywhere. Static. It won't sit right. It won't do what you want.\n\nWash it the day before. Style it the morning of. Your hair will cooperate so much better, and you'll spend way less time fighting with it during the shoot.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nHair up or down? It depends on what job the photo needs to do.\n\nAre you showing your features for beauty work? Up.\n\nAre you showing yourself AS a character type? Match the character.\n\nAre you showing the professional version of yourself? Be yourself, just polished.\n\nStop asking \"which looks better\" and start asking \"what's this photo for?\" That's how you make the right choice every time.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
