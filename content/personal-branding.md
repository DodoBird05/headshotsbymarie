# FAQ
faq:
  - question: "What's the difference between personal branding photos and headshots?"
    answer: "Personal branding photos tell your complete professional story through multiple images that showcase your personality, expertise, and lifestyle. While headshots focus on your face, branding photos include your workspace, props, lifestyle elements, and various expressions to create a comprehensive visual narrative."
  - question: "How should I prepare for my personal branding session?"
    answer: "Bring 3-4 outfits that reflect different aspects of your brand, relevant props or tools from your profession, and think about locations that represent your work style. We'll also discuss your brand message and target audience before the shoot to ensure we capture images that align with your goals."
  - question: "How many photos will I receive from my branding session?"
    answer: "You'll receive a curated gallery to choose from, and you can purchase as many final images as you need. Most clients select 15-25 images to have a comprehensive library for all their marketing needs throughout the year."
  - question: "Can we shoot at multiple locations?"
    answer: "Absolutely! Personal branding sessions often include 2-3 locations - your office or workspace, an outdoor location that reflects your style, and perhaps a more casual setting. Multiple locations help tell a more complete story of who you are professionally."
  - question: "What can I use these photos for?"
    answer: "Your personal branding photos come with full commercial usage rights. Use them for your website, social media, marketing materials, speaking engagements, book covers, media features, business cards, and any other professional marketing needs."
