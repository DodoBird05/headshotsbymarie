testimonial:
  quote: "After 25 years of getting acting headshots in Chicago and Los Angeles I was nervous about getting headshots in Phoenix. BUT Marie was so professional and so keyed in to what I wanted. She understood the difference between my old shots and what I wanted from these new ones. I think they are wonderful and will open new doors and MORE doors for me in my acting."

faqTitle: "Actor Headshots FAQ"
faq:
  - question: "How many looks should I bring?"
    answer: "Bring as many outfit options as you'd like - we have unlimited time and outfit changes. I recommend 3-4 looks: business casual, casual/commercial, more formal, and something that shows your personality."
  - question: "What's the difference between commercial and theatrical headshots?"
    answer: "Commercial headshots are bright, approachable, and friendly - think 'real person' roles. Theatrical headshots are more dramatic with stronger character - think specific roles like detective or villain."
  - question: "Do I keep the photo gallery?"
    answer: "No, you select and purchase only the final retouched images you want. This ensures you get professionally edited headshots rather than raw camera files."
  - question: "How many headshots do I actually need?"
    answer: "Most working actors need 2-4 strong headshots - typically one commercial and one theatrical, plus variations for different casting needs."
  - question: "When will I receive my final images?"
    answer: "Your professionally retouched headshots are delivered within 10 business days of your session."
  - question: "Do you offer slate recordings?"
    answer: "Yes! I can help you record a slate on your phone at no additional charge to create a complete self-tape package."
